In python with the use of numpy we created a [neural-network library](https://github.com/artainmo/NeuralNetworkLib) that we will use in this project, to train a model that will be able to predict if a cancer is malignant or benign on a dataset of breast cancer diagnosis.

# Compatibility:
Programmed on/with:
* MacOs Big Sur 11.2

[Here](https://github.com/artainmo/NeuralNetworkLib) is the neural-network we used.
[Here](https://github.com/artainmo/neural-networks) is the theory behind it.
